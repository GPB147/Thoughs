0 Layers:

	0 Priority of running:

		0 Hardware = [Making rules and limits by electrical language]

		1 Designing hardware by compile languages(Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog)

		2 Firmware = [Initialize and managing specific few hardware by one software per specific hardware by compile language directly(Microcode, Assembly, C, Hardware register)]

		3 Bootloader = [Preparing environment for next layer by one specific software by compile languages(Assembly, C)]

		4 Kernel = [Managing hardware by one specific software by compile language(C, C++, Rust, Assembly)]

		5 Userland0 = [Managing software by specific languages(Shell, Python, C/C++, Configuration languages (YAML, JSON, TOML))]

		6 Userland1 = [Software by a lot of languages(Python, C++, Java, Go, JavaScript, Rust, etc)]

		7 Data flow by specific languages(SQL, HTTP, JSON, XML, Protocol buffers, Binary protocols)
